Student Marks Manager Application
 Project Overview
The Student Marks Manager Application is a Python-based tool designed to help teachers automate the calculation of student grades. Manual grade calculation can be time-consuming and error-prone. This program simplifies the process by instantly generating totals, averages, and grades, while also saving records for future reference.
